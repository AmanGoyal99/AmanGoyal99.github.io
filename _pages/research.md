### Continual Learning at XuLab, Carnegie Mellon University 
Mentors : [Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) and [Dr. Sima Behpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7bmIRwUAAAAJ&hl=en) 

_June 2021 - November 2021

<!-- [//]: # (Primarily, I have been jointly working on curating the novel COncrete DEfect BRidge IMage dataset (CODEBRIM) for multi-target classification of five commonly appearing concrete defects. We have compared two meta-learning approaches to find suitable convolutional neural network architectures for this challenging multi-class multi-target task. We have observed that learned architectures have less overall parameters in addition to yielding better multi-target accuracy in comparison to popular CNN architectures from the literature evaluated in the context of our application.

Continual Learning is perhaps one of the most important areas when it comes to deep learning. This is mainly because, achieving it with minimal catastrophic forgetting could help neural networks not just learn various classes more effectively but it could also put the AI community one step closer in the pursuit of _Artificial General Intelligence_. I had recently worked on a project based on it at the [Xulab](https://xulabs.github.io/), CMU where upon collaboration with [Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) and [Dr. Sima Behpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7bmIRwUAAAAJ&hl=en), we had submitted our work recently at a top tier conference.


### Pruning of Tracking and Detection models for Autonomous Vehicles at Optimization and Trustworthy ML Group, Michigan State University

Since the advent of deep learning, there has always been debates and discussions about the benefits of large networks but with also the drawbacks it comes which are mostly space consumed and problems in deploying for real-world scenarios. Autonomous Vehicles is one such challenging real-world scenario as it requires most efficient models to operate in order to make it as safe as possible for both drivers as well as pedestrians. Currently, I am working with [Prof. Sijia Liu](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/index.html) on this where I am developing lightweight and accurate models for tracking and detection.
