Hey there! Thanks for visiting my page. I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously I have worked as a product manager and deep learning researcher in the domains of computer vision and deep learning.

I had worked  as a Technical Product Manager at Emerging Systems Lab, Intel where my work was focused building models towards neural architectural search, pruning, and the metaverse.

Prior to that,  I had worked as a research intern at [Optimization and Trustworthy ML Group](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/), Michigan State University where I was working on pruning of tracking and detection models for autonomous vehicles. 

Apart from that I had also worked as a research intern at [XuLab](https://xulabs.github.io/), Carnegie Mellon University. My projects were based on the domains of 'Continual Learning' and 'Cryo-ET data analysis'. I had the pleasure of working under the guidance of [Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) and [Dr. Sima Behpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7bmIRwUAAAAJ&hl=en) respectively for the above projects mentioned.
