Hey there ! Thanks for visiting my page. I have recently completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science from NIT Kurukshetra. I am a Deep Learning and Computer Vision Researcher as well. My research interests revolve around Surveillance and Autonomous Vehicles. 
I am currently working as a research intern at XuLab, Carnegie Mellon University. My current projects are based on the domains of 'Continual Learning' and 'Cryo-ET data analysis'. I am working under the guidance of Prof. Min Xu and Dr. Sima Behpour respectively for the above projects mentioned. 
Apart from this, Previously, I had worked as an Applied Research Fellow at Computer Vision Lab, IIIT Hyderabad under the guidance of Prof. Ravi Kiran, Dr. Anbumani Subramaniam and Prof. C.V.Jawahar
