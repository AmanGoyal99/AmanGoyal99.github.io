Hey there ! Thanks for visiting my page. I have recently completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science from NIT Kurukshetra. I am a Deep Learning and Computer Vision Researcher as well. My research interests revolve around Surveillance and Autonomous Vehicles. 
I am currently working as an AI Research Engineer at Emerging Systems Lab, Intel where my work is focused towards neural architectural search, pruning and metaverse.
Previously I had worked as a research intern at [Optimization and Trustworthy ML Group](https://lsjxjtu.github.io/), Michigan State University where I was working on pruning of tracking and detection models for autonomous vehicles. 
Apart from that I had also worked as a research intern at [XuLab](https://xulabs.github.io/), Carnegie Mellon University. My projects were based on the domains of 'Continual Learning' and 'Cryo-ET data analysis'. I had the pleasure of working under the guidance of [Prof. Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/min-xu/) and [Dr. Sima Behpour](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7bmIRwUAAAAJ&hl=en) respectively for the above projects mentioned.
